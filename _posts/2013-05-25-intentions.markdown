As with every new iteration of a personal website my intentions to keep this up to date are pure. Topics to be discussed include design, code, beer, coffee, personal projects and much more.

So, lets start with the underlying technology. This blog is generated by <a href="http://www.jekyllrb.com" target="_blank">jekyll</a> hosted on <a href="http://www.github.com" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. You can view the code <a href="http://www.github.com/ericlindstrom/ericlindstrom.github.com" target="_blank">here</a>. More than one post will have been drafted on a iPhone / iPad / Nexus 7 in <a href="http://www.vim.org" target="_blank">vim</a> or in <a href="http://www.iawriter.com" target="_blank">iawriter</a>.
