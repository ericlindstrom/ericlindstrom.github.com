  ~ an Internet search for "it's not the tools"

I believe tools are very important to the job, but not the most important. I like things, but I find myself working with less these days. 

In the early days, my dev workflow included: textmate, mamp, cssedit, sequel pro, and terminal to run django. I hated the terminal with a passion. It was the eyesore amongst my other semi attractive development apps. I said, "why cant someone create a start/stop app for django." These days, the terminal is my primary tool. Everything in a few different tabs.
